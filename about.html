My name is Francine Dash and I'm really passionate about voting, civil discourse and the protection of our evolving democracy.</h1> <h3> I'm so passionate about this that I created a podcast where I talk to voters from all sorts of backgrounds about the issues that matter most to them and what they want lawmakers to do about it. <p>I want to use what I learn in class/program to better connect people with each other and the diverse ideas.</h3>
